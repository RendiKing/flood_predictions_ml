# Flood Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to predict flood risk based on environmental and geographic data.

## Project Overview
- Developed a flood prediction model using supervised machine learning algorithms.
- Focused on identifying patterns in environmental variables to predict the likelihood of flooding events.
- Emphasized data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to maximize prediction accuracy.

## Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Data visualization and interpretation
- Predictive analytics

## Outcome
Created a predictive model that identifies flood risk based on input features, supporting potential real-world disaster preparedness and response efforts.
